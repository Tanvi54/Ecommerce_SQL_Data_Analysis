# 🛒 E-Commerce SQL Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **SQL data analysis** on an e-commerce database using **MySQL Workbench**.  
It covers:
- Data extraction with filtering & sorting
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG)
- Views for reusable analysis
- Indexes for performance optimization

## 📋 Queries Implemented

### 1️⃣ SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- Retrieved customers from specific locations, sorted alphabetically.  
- Counted the number of products in each category.

### 2️⃣ JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- **INNER JOIN:** Displayed orders along with the customer who placed them.  
- **LEFT JOIN:** Listed all customers, showing order details if available.  
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Listed all vendors with the products they sell.

### 3️⃣ Subqueries
- Found products priced **above the average price** in the database.

### 4️⃣ Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG)
- Calculated **total** and **average** quantity ordered per customer.

### 5️⃣ Views for Analysis
- Created a view `TopSellingProducts` to quickly check which products sell the most.

### 6️⃣ Optimizing Queries with Indexes
- Added indexes on frequently used columns like `CustomerID` in Orders and `ProductID` in VendorProduct to improve query performance.
